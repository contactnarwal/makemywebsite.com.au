            Marketing is the backbone of any business and none can shrug off its
            value. This certainly is our competitive advantage. To build a
            rewarding marketing program and maintaining it thereafter, several
            tools exist online. But a few of them are search engine optimization
            campaigns, pay-per-click, banner advertising, email marketing,
            etcetera.
          </P>

          <P>
            These remain different from the conventional marketing strategies
            because the former ones possess the ability to widen the reach
            manifolds, globally.

          <P>
            Since the competition is neck and neck, and businesses have so many
            tasks to perform, they are hiring web and email hosting firms for
            their convenience. There is a belief that registering a domain name
            is just enough, to begin with, a website.
          </P>

          <P>
            But, it entirely contradicts with the fact that a domain is just
            like your name, a name to address you. To get a site active and live
            on the internet, hosting a website is of utmost need.
