          Since the competition is neck and neck, and businesses have so many
          tasks to perform, they are hiring web and email hosting firms for
          their convenience. There is a belief that registering a domain name is

          with the fact that a domain is just like your name, a name to address
          you. To get a site active and live on the internet, hosting a website
          is of utmost need.
